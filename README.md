# Explicimate
*A tool for flagging explicit tracks in your music library for Radio Station Managers*

Explicimate is provided by KCL Radio, the Student Radio station of King's College London. It's a free tool open for use by anyone.

## How to Use
Currently Explicimate is provided as a Node module. This means you'll require Node.js installed already. If there is demand, we may consider re-engineering it into a standalone executable.
